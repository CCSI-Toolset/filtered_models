# Filtered Models
Filtered models for the hydrodynamics and heat transfer associated with horizontal cylindrical objects in a flow path.

## Getting Started
See installation and user guide documents:
* [Gas Particle Cylinder 2D Models](./gas-particle-cylinder_2d_models/docs)
* [Gas Solid 3D Models](./gas-solid-3d-models/docs) 

## Authors
* William Lane

## Development Practices
* Code development will be peformed in a forked copy of the repo. Commits will not be 
  made directly to the repo. Developers will submit a pull request that is then merged
  by another team member, if another team member is available.
* Each pull request should contain only related modifications to a feature or bug fix.  
* Sensitive information (secret keys, usernames etc) and configuration data 
  (e.g database host port) should not be checked in to the repo.
* A practice of rebasing with the main repo should be used rather that merge commmits.
